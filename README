This code parallalises XTB to optimise geometaries from xyz files.

It has been written to distribute xtb jobs over up to 28 cpus on a blue crystal node

To use it you need:

1)to install conda forge

2)use conda forge to install xtb and create a conda environment which contains xtb

3)make sure the conda environment isnt activate when you submit a job as if 
  you are already in teh env ten when the code tries to switch into the env
  it wont work

4)put any files you want optimised into the input files directory found in /data/

5)submit the batch file you can edit ntaskspernode to control how many cpus the code is run on

6)error codes are piped to the parallel_xtb.err file and the slurm output is piped to parallel_xtb.out
